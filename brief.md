# HTML Injection

## Description:
HTML Injection, also known as Code Injection, occurs when an attacker can inject malicious HTML code into a web application. This allows them to manipulate the appearance or functionality of the targeted web page.

## Impact:
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** HTML Injection can lead to the execution of malicious scripts on the user's browser, potentially compromising user data, session tokens, or spreading malware.
- **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can craft HTML to mimic legitimate login forms or pages, leading users to unknowingly submit sensitive information.

# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Injection

## Description:
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of injection attack where attackers inject malicious scripts into web applications, which are then executed by the victim's browser.

## Impact:
- **Data Theft:** Attackers can steal sensitive user data such as login credentials, session tokens, or personal information.
- **Session Hijacking:** XSS can be used to hijack user sessions, allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate users.
- **Malicious Actions:** Attackers can perform actions on behalf of the user, leading to unauthorized activities.

# Open Redirect

## Description:
Open Redirect occurs when a web application allows external inputs to redirect users to external sites. Attackers exploit this vulnerability to redirect users to malicious websites.

## Impact:
- **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can trick users into visiting malicious websites by disguising harmful URLs as legitimate ones.
- **Session Theft:** Open Redirect can be combined with other attacks to steal user sessions, compromising user accounts.
- **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious sites may lead to the download or execution of malware on their devices.
