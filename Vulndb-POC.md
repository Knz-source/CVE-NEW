The function "redirectTo" on "https://teamworksvs.com/?redirectTo=" is vulnerable to Open Redirect and Reflected XSS, those issues could be chained to create attack vectors that impact on the integrity and confidentiality of the personal information holded by each account https://teamworksvs.com/?redirectTo=. AND the function "error" on "https://teamworksvs.com/?error=$$" is vulnerable to Reflected XSS and HTML Injection, those issues could be chained to create attack vectors that impact on the integrity and confidentiality of the personal information holded by each account https://teamworksvs.com/?redirectTo=.

<h1>Open Redirect Mitigation and best practices</h1>
Mitigating Open Redirect are such easy task
It occurs when the webapp allows an attacker to redirect users to external websites of their choosing using internal mechanisms or vulnerable features. 
Whitelist Valid Redirect URLs
Maintain a predefined list of valid redirect URLs and only allow redirects to those specific domains or paths. This helps restrict redirection to trusted destinations.
Implement a safe redirect mechanism within the application. Avoid relying solely on user-provided input for constructing redirect URLs. Use server-side logic to generate and validate redirection URLs.
Refrain from using user-controlled input directly in the redirect parameters. Validate and sanitize user input thoroughly to prevent injection attacks.
Enforce the Same-Origin Policy to ensure that the redirect is only permitted within the same origin, preventing attackers from redirecting users to malicious external sites.


<h1>XSS and HTML injection best practices</h1>
The function "error" on "https://teamworksvs.com/?error=$$" is vulnerable to Reflected XSS and HTML Injection, those issues could be chained to create attack vectors that impact on the integrity and confidentiality of the personal information holded by each account https://teamworksvs.com/?redirectTo=.

Leverage browser security features like the X-Content-Type-Options header to prevent MIME-sniffing and the X-XSS-Protection header to enable the browser's XSS filter.
Implement security headers, including X-Frame-Options and Strict-Transport-Security, to enhance overall web application security and protect against certain XSS vectors. 
Validate and sanitize all user inputs, both on the client and server sides, to prevent the injection of malicious scripts. Use input validation libraries and frameworks.
Implement a strong Content Security Policy to control which resources can be loaded and executed on a web page. This includes specifying trusted sources for scripts, styles, and other resources
Encode user-generated content appropriately before rendering it in the browser. HTML entities encoding, JavaScript encoding, and URL encoding can prevent script execution.
Mark cookies as HTTP-only to prevent them from being accessed through JavaScript. This limits the impact of XSS attacks targeting session data
