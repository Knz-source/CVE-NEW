Mitigating Open Redirect are such easy task
It occurs when the webapp allows an attacker to redirect users to external websites of their choosing using internal mechanisms or vulnerable features. 
Whitelist Valid Redirect URLs
Maintain a predefined list of valid redirect URLs and only allow redirects to those specific domains or paths. This helps restrict redirection to trusted destinations.
Implement a safe redirect mechanism within the application. Avoid relying solely on user-provided input for constructing redirect URLs. Use server-side logic to generate and validate redirection URLs.
Refrain from using user-controlled input directly in the redirect parameters. Validate and sanitize user input thoroughly to prevent injection attacks.
Enforce the Same-Origin Policy to ensure that the redirect is only permitted within the same origin, preventing attackers from redirecting users to malicious external sites.
